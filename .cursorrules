# E-Commerce Project Rules for Cursor AI

## Project Context
- Next.js 14 App Router E-Commerce website
- TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, TanStack Query
- Atomic Design Pattern architecture
- shadcn/ui for UI components

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (no CSS modules)
- Follow Atomic Design Pattern for components
- Use React Query for server state management
- Use Zustand for client state management
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states

## Component Rules
- All components must have proper TypeScript interfaces
- Use forwardRef for components that need ref forwarding
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Follow naming convention: PascalCase for components
- Export components as named exports with default export

## File Structure
- components/atoms/ - Basic UI elements (Button, Input, etc.)
- components/molecules/ - Simple combinations (SearchBar, ProductCard)
- components/organisms/ - Complex combinations (Header, ProductGrid)
- components/templates/ - Page layouts
- hooks/ - Custom React hooks with 'use' prefix
- lib/ - Utility functions and configurations
- types/ - TypeScript type definitions
- stores/ - Zustand state stores

## Import Order
1. React and Next.js imports
2. Third-party libraries
3. Internal components (atoms → molecules → organisms)
4. Hooks and utilities
5. Types and constants

## Supabase Integration
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Use TypeScript types generated from Supabase schema
- Handle authentication state properly

## Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Implement infinite scrolling with React Query
- Use proper caching strategies

## Never Do
- Don't use inline styles
- Don't ignore TypeScript errors
- Don't forget error handling
- Don't skip loading states
- Don't use any type unless absolutely necessary
